# Notify

This is a recreation of a project I built during my time at Flatiron School. 

That project was just HTML and JavaScript with some CSS splattered here and there.

This version will be full fleshed out and fully functional.

It will use the Spotify API to access your Spotify account, and create / edit / delete playlists with a neat interface.

The backend is built using Python and Flask, the frontend is build using React and Bootstrap.

To start the server, navigate to `/notify/server` and run the backend application with `flask run`.

Then to start the frontend, navigate to `/notify/notify` and run the frontend application with `npm run`.

This will change when deployed.

Dependencies: 
- Python ^3
- Flask ^2
- React ^18
